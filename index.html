        Dear Sir Neiljan,
      </p>
      <p >
        I wanted to take this moment to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible opportunities you have given me and the deep 
        impact you have had on my life. Your unwavering belief in my capabilities and your decision to include me in your team for the
         European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines Research Grant have been truly transformative. It opened doors to experiences and 
         learning that I never thought possible. Your trust and guidance throughout the process have allowed me to grow and excel in 
         ways I could never have imagined.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         I am also grateful for the life lessons you have imparted to me. Your role as a teacher extends far beyond the classroom, 
         as you have shown care and support for me not only as a student but also as a friend. Your mentorship and friendship have 
         been invaluable, shaping not only my academic pursuits but also my personal growth. Thank you for seeing potential in me and 
         giving me the opportunity to be a part of something meaningful. Your belief in my abilities has given me the confidence to reach 
         for the stars. I am forever grateful for the impact you have had on my life, and I will carry the lessons I have learned from you 
         with me always.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        With heartfelt appreciation,
      </p>
      <p>
        Fritz
